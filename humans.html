            <h2>Krillin</h2>
        <p>Krillin is a supporting protagonist in the Dragon Ball franchise.Krillin had a brief rivalry with Goku when they first met and trained under Master Roshi, but they quickly became lifelong best friends.[9] One of the most powerful and talented martial artists on Earth, Krillin is courageous, faithful, and good-natured. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu Saga onwards) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments. During the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, he largely retires from fighting, opting to settle down with his family instead, becoming the husband of Android 18 and the father of Marron. However, he returns to his lifestyle as a warrior later on in Dragon Ball Super.Like any other human Krillin does not possess a transformation.</p>

            <h2>Tien Shinhan</h2>
            <p>Tien Shinhan is a disciplined, reclusive and heavily devoted martial artist, and one of the strongest Earthlings within the Dragon Ball universe. He also possesses a few non-human traits due to being descended from the Three-Eyed People. He was originally a student of the Crane School who desired revenge against Goku for defeating his mentor, Mercenary Tao, but realized he was on the wrong side with the help of Master Roshi. He battles alongside the other Z Fighters against major threats to the Earth surface, often courageously engaging enemies far more powerful than himself. However, he spends most of his time training with his lifelong best friend, Chiaotzu.</p></li>
