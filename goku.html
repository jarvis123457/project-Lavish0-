        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Goku  is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.Initially believed to have been born on Earth, Goku later learns that he is a member of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans, which is also the reason for his superhuman strength, and his birth name is Kakarot. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and protects his adopted home planet from those who seek to destroy it. Goku is depicted as carefree and cheerful when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle and also enthusiastic to fight. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature Kamehameha in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms. Also pure of heart, Goku has frequently granted mercy to his enemies, which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness). With passage of Dragon Ball series in Dragon Ball Z and Super, Goku with extensive training and fights with foes even powerful than him, achieves different transformations to make him able to defeat his opponents.</p>
