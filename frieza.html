        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Frieza is a fictional character and villain in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the Dragon Ball franchise due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story due to the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, the first death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy, and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.Unlike Goku and Vegeta who achieved more power with their transformations, Frieza used his first four transformations to suppress his base power level.</p>
