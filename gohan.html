        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Son Gohan is a character in the Dragon Ball manga series, created by Akira Toriyama. Gohan is introduced as the first son 
            of the protagonist Goku, and his wife Chi-Chi. Chi-Chi is a strict and protective mother to Gohan, forcing him to focus 
            on his studies and forbidding him from practicing martial arts. However, due to the various threats to the Earth, she 
            reluctantly allows him to fight, with him ultimately becoming one of the strongest characters in the series. Gohan has 
            been well received by both fans and critics, the latter usually citing the character's growth from his initial appearance
            to his defeat of Cell.Being a Half-Saiyan didn't really affected Gohan's powers as he unlocked Super Saiyan 2 and becoming
            most powerful at the time of defeating Cell.</p>
