            <h2>Android 17</h2>
        <p>Android 17, Lapis when he was an ordinary human, is the twin brother of Android 18 and Dr. Gero's seventeenth android creation, designed to serve Gero's vendetta against Goku. Despite his interests not initially deviating from this expectation, Android 17 takes it upon himself to kill Dr. Gero, who is uncooperative with Android 18's curiosity in activating Android 16 and deemed inferior by 17.Android 17 makes a return a decade later in Dragon Ball Super, working as a national park ranger preserving wildlife from poachers. He is married and has a child, with two more children being adopted. He is asked by Goku to join Team Universe 7 in the Tournament of Power and due to Goku and Frieza's sacrifice to take out Jiren, he is left as the sole fighter remaining by the end of the tournament and the one who makes the wish on the Super Dragon Balls.Android 17 does not have any transformations he just trains to increase his power in base form.</p>

            <p>Android 18 originally named Lazuli when she was an ordinary human, is the twin sister of Android 17 and Dr. Gero's eighteenth android creation, designed to serve Gero's vendetta against Goku. While her interests do not initially deviate from this expectation, her curiosity to activate Android 16, in spite of Gero's orders not to do so, leads Android 17 to take it upon himself to murder Gero. Eventually, Android 18 becomes a member of the Z Fighters, as well as the wife of Krillin and the mother of their daughter Marron. Like Android 17, 18 does not posses any other form than base and shows power levels similar to 18</p>
